# Census-and-Ag-Labor
Public repository for documentation of the USDA Census and Agriculture Labor Project.

USDA census data used for this project is available from the NASS USDA Website: <https://www.nass.usda.gov/datasets/qs.census2022.txt.gz>.

Jupyter Notebooks are used to display the steps taken to form the data for use in visualizations related to this project. At this time, one visualization is available for viewing, located at: <https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sieger.bokschoten/viz/USDACensusandAgricultureLabor/CommoditySalesDashboard>.

## Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks will be created for each data set created and used in a visualization, documenting the steps taken to prepare the data for the project. Each notebook will be uploaded to the "Notebooks" folder and will describe the source of the data and contain all the steps taken before exporting the file for use. After the file has been exported, the CSV file will be added to the "ExportedData" folder for ease of use.
